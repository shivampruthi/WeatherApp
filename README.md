# WeatherApp
This project is a weather application written in Java. It allows the user to enter a location and get the weather-related information such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and country. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the data and JSON Parser to parse the response from the API.

The user can enter the location in the application and the app will send a GET request to the API using the URL. The response from the API is parsed using JSON Parser and the values such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and country are extracted from the JSON Object. The values are then printed on the console. The application also takes user input to specify the temperature units, so the user can get the weather information in their preferred unit. The API data can be updated periodically to get the latest weather information.

This application can also be used to get the weather-related information about other locations. All the user has to do is enter the location and the application will fetch the weather information from the API. The API data can be used to display the weather-related information on a website or in a mobile application. The application can be used to display the current weather conditions and to forecast the weather for the upcoming days. The application can also be used to alert the user of any potentially dangerous weather conditions, such as heavy rain or thunderstorms.

The technologies required for this project are Java, JSON Parser, and OpenWeatherMap API.
